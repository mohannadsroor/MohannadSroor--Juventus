<p class="a">The First Robot </p>
    
   <center> <div id="gradient"><h3>The first recorded use of the word "robot" was in a 1920 play called "R.U.R." (Rossum's<br> Universal Robots) by Czech playwright Karel ÄŒapek. In the play, robots are artificially created<br> beings that are meant to serve humans. The word<br> "robot" comes from the Czech word "robota," which means "forced labor."<br><br>
   

The first physical robot is generally considered to be the Unimate, developed in the 1950s by <del>George Devol and Joseph</del> <br>F. Engelberger. The Unimate was a robot arm that was used in manufacturing to perform tasks such as<br> welding and die casting. It was first installed at a General Motors plant in 1961, and its success led to the widespread use of robots in manufacturing.<br><br>


The Unimate was not the first mechanical device to be called a robot, however. There were earlier examples of devices <br>that could perform tasks automatically, such as the "turk," a chess-playing machine built in the late<br> 18th century. The turk was actually a hoax, as it was operated by a human hidden inside the device.<br><br>

Overall, the history of robots is a long and varied one, with the concept of robots being present in myth and legend for centuries, and the development of practical robots beginning in the 20th century.
